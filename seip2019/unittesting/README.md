# SEiP_Assignments

This is a project containing an assignment to get familiar with Unit Testing.
The files contain *Test classes that test possible scenarios of executing methods of a class.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Follow the instructions in the projects's [Prerequisites](https://github.com/chrisfaltsetas/SEiP_Assignments/blob/master/README.md#prerequisites) in order to download and install the required tools to build and run this program.

### Running the program

While building the project with Maven from the [instructions](https://github.com/chrisfaltsetas/SEiP_Assignments/blob/master/README.md#installing), Maven will run the *Test classes and collect the results of the tests in class specific files in the
``` seip2019/unittesting/target/surefire-reports/``` folder. The results will also be shown at the end of the test process.

Note: You can also run the ```mvn test``` command to test the classes and skip the jar packaging process, as it is not needed
in the specific project - there is not main method.

## Built With
